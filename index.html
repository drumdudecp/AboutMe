<h2>"Haiku For You"</h2>
<p>
    This haiku was inspired by the goal of writing a haiku.<br>
    It is therefore about a haiku.<br><br>
    <pre><i>
    I think a haiku<br>
    would be fun to write today<br>
    I made it for you<br>

<h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
<p>I love music. I started on piano around 10 years old and then moved to
    the drumset around 11. I have bachelors and masters degrees in music
    and am a full-time musician and educator. I produce music using Ableton Live
    co-organizer of the Ableton User Group Salt Lake.
</p>
<p >A few years ago I was introduced to a book called <i>Getting Things Done</i>
    by David Allen. It's all about personal organization and stress free productivity.
    Since then, I have been building a personal organizational system.
    I have read the book several times since and am very interested in the topic of 
    productivity.
</p>
<p>My journey into personal finance started when I listened to Dave Ramsey's
    show. This got me into living frugally and getting out of debt. Since then
    I've begun studying investing and am working towards an early retirement path
    inspired by Jacob Lund Fisker's <i>Early Retirement Extreme.</i>
